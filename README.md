# Graph
This is a graph data project.

# Description
* Building classes to manage and maintain graph data.
* Optimizations will be added to create methods to read graph data.
* Methods under consideration is graph index, graph entity categorization and label.
* Index will be based on the category of the graph.
     * Idea for the index is to possibly optimize the seek for the data related to a category.
     * The Query engine for reads will use the category to scan the index.
     * The key from the index will be used to derive relationship.
     * All relationship will be displayed with the key joining the relationship.
